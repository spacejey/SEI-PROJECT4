# STAY COOL - Ice Cream Truck Tracking App
## General Assembly Project 4
##### I absolutely adore ice cream trucks! The idea for this project stemmed from the inconvenience of not having a truck nearby when I was craving some delicious ice cream. With this application, users can effortlessly locate nearby trucks based on their current location and even access their operating hours. Furthermore, registered users have the ability to leave comments on the trucks they have visited. By utilizing this app, we can track ice cream trucks at our preferred times. Here's to everyone having a delightful ice cream experience!

### Brief
##### I utilized Django RESTful Framework to construct API and defined serializers to handle data serialization and deserialization. Routing was established to configure API endpoints. For the frontend, I used React and SASS. I utilized Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to incorporate the map functionality, and personally developed a custom database for each truck.

### Wireframe

##### As depicted in the provided wireframe, my plan was to have a main page featuring a map and a truck list. Clicking on each truck card would lead to an individual truck page. On the truck's single page, logged-in users would have the ability to leave comments.
